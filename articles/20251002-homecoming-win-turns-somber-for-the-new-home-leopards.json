Junior Bransen Beckham and Sophomore Wyatt Tunell collided headfirst going in for a tackle. The whole team had heartfelt reactions to their teammates' injuries, so they held a group prayer on the field. They all circled Beckham and said a prayer while they waited for the ambulance to arrive. Tunnell got up and walked away, but later on, both players were carried away in an ambulance. They both went to the hospital and got released late Friday night.\n\nAfter the injured players were carried away by the ambulance, they continued the game, with the somber feeling casting a pall over the rest of the game.\n\nNew Home took the lead early with Junior Lincoln Preston scoring the first touchdown. Prior to the injuries, the atmosphere in the stands was energetic, lively, and vibrant. Students in the student section played music on speakers, threw confetti, and chanted loudly. The stands were packed and rowdy as New Home scored touchdown after touchdown.\n\nAt halftime, the Roscoe band performed for everyone before the homecoming court made its way onto the field. That’s where Ryder Starkey and Kirklyn Fulton were crowned king and queen. With the final score being 30-3, New Home won their homecoming game. They ended their win by lining up on the field as the school song began to play. Even with all the ups and downs, it was a positive way to end the night.\n\nThe Leopards begin district play at 3-1 as they play Abernathy on October 10.\n",
