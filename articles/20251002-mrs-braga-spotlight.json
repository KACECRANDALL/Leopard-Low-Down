I like to interact with kids. It's good that even though it's repetitive, especially for my job because it's a new language it's just kind of different. I like New Home. It's nice how we get to know each other and the community makes it very special.\n\n**When you're not teaching, what do you like to do on the weekends with your family?**\n\nSometimes I like to do nothing, but my favorite thing is doing sports with my kids, watching Alicia do gymnastics and watching Mateo play baseball. That's what we usually do and that's what makes me happiest.\n\n**Do you like living in America?**\n\nI love living in America. I miss my people all the time. It's a constant missing feeling but I wouldn't go back to live there. I wish I had more opportunities to go more often to see them, but because I do love living in New Home I think it's a great opportunity for me, Charlie, and my kids. It's a great place and I'm glad we’re here.\n",
