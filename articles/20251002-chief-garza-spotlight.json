In his interview, he explains how he got into law enforcement and where he stands now. He started working for the Texas Department of Criminal Justice and did that for 15 years. Garza was doing presentations about gangs, tattoo recognition, and their correspondence to know what to look for in gang members. They told him he was in the wrong business, so he jumped in to attend the Peace Officer Academy at South Plains College. That’s where he got his license and started his official police journey. When asked about the scariest moment in his career, Garza said, “If you don’t come into this job with a sense of natural fear with things…or situations…then you’re not built for this job. It just heightens your senses…” Garza has been in law enforcement for 13 years, and coming to New Home was a new opportunity for him. The New Home Police Department is only in its second year, and Chief Garza is hoping to make it grow. Something he has learned from being at different schools is how there’s a basic plan for each campus. As long as he sticks to the plan, he’ll know what to do, regardless of the size of the school. What has impacted him the most is getting a call from a past student he taught. Chief Garza was used as the kid's reference for an opportunity to work as a police officer. He’s glad he’s set a foundation for him and is proud of what he’s doing now. There’s some things people may not know about Garza. For example, he’s from Lamesa and has been married for 26 years. His 3 kids are all grown up, but he has a 4 year old grandson. He loves his job and is enjoying his time at New Home. His main goal is to make an impact, and help the New Home Police Department grow.\n",
