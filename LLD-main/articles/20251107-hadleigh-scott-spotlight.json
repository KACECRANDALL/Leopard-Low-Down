It’s everything that we need before we start a [next] chapter of our lives.\n\nWhat's been your favorite memory while being Lila the Leopard?\n\nMy favorite memory has to be my very first pep rally when I was in seventh grade, I believe. When I had finished dancing, the skirt Lila was wearing had fallen down, and everyone started laughing. It was that moment that I [realized] I just loved to make people laugh.\n\nHow has cheer shaped you into the person you are today?\n\nCheering has been very fun for me ever since I started doing it in middle school. I've been a part of a team, even though I'm doing my own thing. The cheer girls do their best to make me feel included, and I find that very sweet. Cheer has been a big part of my life because I get to go to all these camps, and get to meet with the cheerleaders. It has allowed me to be a leader for other mascots.\n\nWhy did you decide to join cross country this year?\n\nI decided to join cross country so I could prepare myself for the physical test of the Army ROTC scholarship that I'm applying for, since I'm going into the ROTC when I get to college.\n\nHow did you want to get into the ROTC program plan?\n\nWell, my end goal is to go into the FBI. When looking at options, my dad suggested, \"Why don't you look at the Army route or anything like that?\" And I was like, “That's a good idea, because he can see me doing the physical, the physical part in being mentally tough in the army. And it's challenging enough for me where I can make a career out of that before I go into the FBI.\n\nWhere do you see yourself within the next five years?\n\nI hope to see myself applying for the FBI Academy, but if that doesn't work out, I hope to be graduating college. I want to start my four year requirements for the Army, and possibly in military intelligence.\n",
