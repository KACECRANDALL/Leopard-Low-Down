She wants the players to know that they’re more than who they are on the court and to be confident no matter what. Coach Aycock shares a similar focus, saying that he enjoys watching the girls grow not only as athletes but as people.\n\nJunior player Dyllan McMinn said one of the team’s biggest strengths is their teamwork. “ We're learning from each other really well and kind of just supporting each other and encouraging each other.”She said.\n\nThe Lady Leopards are holding themselves high, while being encouraged by both coaches and teammates. Dyllan has attended New Home since first grade, Coach Aycock and Coach Pickett have each been with the school for four years and say they do see the progress in the program for girls basketball.\n\n“basketball is like poetry in motion”\n\n-Coach Aycock\n\nCoach Aycock is describing his passion for the game as well as the love he has for his players and the hopes his love for basketball is shared to his players. Coach Pickett has made a comment on her own recent love for the sport and hopes to get better at coaching and to continue improving and growing with the players.\n\nOver the years, the Lady leopards have learned how to support and grow with time. Learning each other's strengths and weaknesses and helping each other to grow and get better not as a player but as a student. With their teamwork and dedication, the Lady Leopards are ready for what promises to be an exciting season. All coaches have a big goal in mind, and that includes a win for a state championship. These coaches believe in their players to know they have what it takes to win that championship.\n",
