Currently, Mrs. Clark is a full-time sub, and her smiling face is seen in various classrooms throughout the day.\n\nWhen asked why she subs, she said, “Because I love you guys!” Mrs. Clark has always been big on subbing around her kids and us.\n\nWhen asked if she would ever want to become a teacher, she said she would rather not since she mostly enjoys going to other classes and seeing different kids.\n\nMrs. Clark’s favorite part of the job is seeing the kids every day. Mrs. Clark always seems to know one thing that everyone needs in the morning is a hug. She greets the kids at the front doors with open arms.\n\nMrs. Clark said the greatest thing she has done has been transferring her boys to New Home. She also enjoys her free time out of school and now that she’s a full time substitute she enjoys her weekends.\n",
