Senior Keaton Bullard played a detective trying to solve a murder. He endlessly made the audience guess when trying to find out who the murderer was. All of the actors stayed in character the whole time. Dyllan McMinn, Kaden McDonald, and Hadleigh Scott were the main characters. They had two different parts throughout the play. This play definitely kept the audience entertained and ambitious. The actors had great responses to each other, which made the play come together.\n\nFreshman Ethan Glover continuously made the audience chuckle when his character didn’t want to do any work. Sophomore Baleigh Denton played a determined child. When thieves tried to take her candy, she showed them up. Another standout moment came from Sophomores Kambry Burk and Khyler Rodriguez, who made sure the sound and lights were spot on.\n\nA big part of the play was the scene changes. All of the crew moved chairs and tables to get the next scene ready. They helped with costume changes and makeup. At the end of the play, there was a surprising twist, and the audience was in shock. The play was directed by Mrs. Jackson and Mrs. Horn. “Alibis” showed people that the New Home Theatre program can deliver comedy and mystery. Whatever they bring to the stage next spring is very promising.\n",
