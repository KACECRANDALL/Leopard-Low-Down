It shows school spirit for homecoming week; it's also a fundraiser for our school. There were many booths and games. The kids surrounded the bouncy houses all night long.\n\nWinning goldfish as a prize made its comeback. Almost everyone had a goldfish in their hand by the end of the night.\n\nA new game appeared, the dunking booth. The dunking booth was a very popular game, and some high school students volunteered to get dunked. The kids got a lot of laughter from this booth.\n\nA couple of food trucks attended. In addition, Domino's pizza and snow cones were sold at booths.\n\nToward the end of the night, the varsity football team came out on fire trucks, keeping the tradition going. The cheerleaders performed a few of their dances.\n\nOnce all the football team and cheerleaders got introduced, they began to light the big N and H on fire. The school song began to play, and everyone started leaving slowly. After the majority of the crowd cleared out, the seniors took in their last fall festival by spray painting the roads.\n\nThis will surely be a night to remember for the Leopard Nation.\n",
