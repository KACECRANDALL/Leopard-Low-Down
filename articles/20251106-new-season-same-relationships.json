When asked how coaching has changed his life for the better, Coach Jones reflects on his coaching philosophy.\n\n“Coaching allows me to minister kids more so than I would be able to as a teacher,” Jones said. “I’m able to hopefully live my life and share my faith in a way that reflects Christ and ultimately brings more people to him.”\n\nAbney spoke about his accomplishments while being at New Home, and how it shaped the relationships with his players. He explains his answer in the next section.\n\n“We’ve been very blessed to have really good players, and win a lot of games and trophies.

They’ve helped him grow as a person and a player.\n\n“Coach Abney has helped keep me disciplined, humble, and make sure I do everything the right way,” Armes said.\n\nAs the team prepares to begin the season, Coach Jones knows the offseason preparation will pay off during the season.\n\n“First game of the year will be without the guys that play football, so they’ll be a little bit short ground for numbers,” Jones said. “I think they’ve been doing a good job in the off season and all, so I think they’ll do good.”\n\nAbney shares Coach Jones’s perspective on how the first game will go.\n\n“Trying to figure out how the different puzzle pieces fit together this year is always a process, and I know that'll take a little bit of time,” Abney said. “I just hope that we play hard,try to do things the right way, and everything else will kind of work itself out.”\n",
